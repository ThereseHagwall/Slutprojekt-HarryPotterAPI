## Description

This is my final project in a Web programming using JavaScript – in-depth course.

The main task was to find an api that I liked. Create a web page using AJAX, typescript and sass.

I chose to use two different api´s: https://hp-api.onrender.com/ and http://www.theboywholivedapi.fun/

The specific URL i have used is:

1. https://legacy--api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/houses/
2. https://hp-api.onrender.com/api/characters
3. https://hp-api.onrender.com/api/spells

## Technologies

-   Typescript
-   Html
-   AJAX
-   Sass

## How to use

When you first get to the web page, you are greeted by a text saying that you should choose your favorite. Here you choose the house you most prefer, and if you don't have a favorite (YET), you can also choose no favorite.
If you later change your mind and want to change house. You can do this by changing the theme. And then you will get the information about that particular house instead. And the color theme will match the colors of that house.

On this Website you can find information about all Harry Potter characters and spells. You can also save your favorite characters in their own section so you can find them quickly and easily. Once you've saved a character, you can also change your mind and remove it from your favorites.

## Clone to local machine & compile

Open you favorite terminal, for example: git bash.
Navigate to the folder where you want to put the repository.

1. `git clone https://github.com/ThereseHagwall/Slutprojekt-HarryPotterAPI.git`
2. Enter repository directory
3. `code .` (If you use visual studie code, else, run the code whit you favorit program)

#### Compile the Typescript

4. Type in the terminal `tsc` for compile once or `tsc--w` for the compiler to always watch for changes.

#### Compile the Sass

5. Type in the terminal `sass src/scss:dist/css` for compile once or `sass src/scss:dist/css --watch` for the compiler to always watch for changes
6. "Go live", if you have this extension, or open the HTML file.
