## Description

This is a final project in my course Web programming using JavaScript – in-depth.

The main task was to find an api that I liked. Create a web page using AJAX, typescript and sass.

I chose to use two different api´s, these two: https://hp-api.onrender.com/ and http://www.theboywholivedapi.fun/

The specific URL i have used is

1. https://legacy--api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/houses/
2. https://hp-api.onrender.com/api/characters
3. https://hp-api.onrender.com/api/spells
